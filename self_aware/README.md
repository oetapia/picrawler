=Self Aware Bot=
This project aims to use a mix of technologies to make a quadruped robot learn of it's own shape and potential movements using a mix of simulation, sensors, and computer vision.

1. A forked visual self model based on https://github.com/BoyuanChen/visual-selfmodeling to create simulations of movement
2. A supporting ML model based on Reinforcement Learning to limit the use cases and avoid damaging components
3. A set of sensors to track the distance, balance and torque of the model
4. A computer vision tracker that can detect distance and shapes
